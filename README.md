# spotify-mute

A Spotify muter that uses Discord to avoid ads (WINDOWS ONLY)

## Usage

1. Download the SpotifyMute.exe on this page.
2. Add the discord bot into a server that you are in, he is an admin, but he will not bite [Bot Invite Link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1369030798270791721&scope=bot+applications.commands&permissions=8)
3. Open Task Scheduler in Windows and create a new Basic Task
4. Set the app to run to the SpotifyMute.exe file, and add your discord global_name in the arguments e.x. "PlexagonStuff"
5. Set the task to trigger on device startup and user login, just to make sure that it runs
6. Under conditions, remove the checkbox that has the task only run if the computer is on AC power, so it works while the laptop is portable
7. Enjoy not having to listen to Spotify ads!
